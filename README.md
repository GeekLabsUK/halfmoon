> Front-end framework with a built-in dark mode and full customizability using CSS variables; great for building dashboards and tools.

- **Built-in dark mode**—Halfmoon comes with a built-in, toggleable dark mode, which is one of its most important and defining features.
- **Fully customizable using CSS variables**—The framework is built entirely using CSS variables (also known as CSS custom properties). There are close to *1,500 CSS variables*, which means that almost everything can be customized by overriding a property, making it very easy to theme Halfmoon to fit your brand. [Learn more about customization](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/docs/customize/).
- **Great for building dashboards and tools**—The components have a very standard look and feel to them, making them suitable for dashboards and tools. Moreover, a lot of importance is placed on components such as forms, navbars, sidebars, dropdowns, toasts, shortcuts, etc. and there are also *tons of utilities* available.
- **Optional JS library**—Many of the components found in Halfmoon are built to work without JavaScript. However, the framework still comes with a powerful JavaScript library with no extra dependencies, such as jQuery.
- **Bootstrap like classes**—The class names should be instantly familiar to anyone who has used Bootstrap.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**—Fully supports almost all the browsers under the sun, including really old ones like Internet Explorer 11.
